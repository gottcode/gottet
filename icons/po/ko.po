"Gottet is a falling blocks game. Pieces fall from the top of the play area "
"and you can move them horizontally as well as rotate them before they reach "
"the bottom of the play area. The goal is to create full lines of pieces, "
"which are then removed. The game is over when the stack of pieces reaches "
"the top of the play area."
